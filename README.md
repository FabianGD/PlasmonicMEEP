# PlasmonicMEEP

## What this is

This repo consists of a set of scripts for calculation of plasmon resonance/electric field enhancement on different structures.
Scripts are powered by FDTD solver [MEEP](https://github.com/NanoComp/meep).
The scripts are originally taken from [Trel725/plasmon-meep](https://github.com/Trel725/plasmon-meep).

## How it works

1. Meep simulates interaction of structure of interest with EM waves, producing arrays
   describing field distribution in space and time. Simulation is done twice, for
   the empty cell (reference run) and for the cell containing structure.
2. The FFT is performed on arrays from previous step, thus tranforming electric fields
   to frequency domain.
3. Complex values of tranformed fields are squared, producing energiy density at
   given frequncies.
4. Densities of normal run are normalized by reference run, which directly gives
   EM field enhancement distribution in space and frequency

## Installation

To install the package, first install [MEEP](https://meep.readthedocs.io) using the [install instructions](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/) on their website. For the calculations proposed here it's re recommended to install the parallel version via **conda**.

### Installing conda and MEEP

Basically, on a Unix or WSL system, all you need to run the following commands in order. For more detailed instructions, see the [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and [MEEP](https://meep.readthedocs.io) homepages

```bash
# To install conda on your machine. In the installation wizard you can change
# things like prefixes for installation etc.
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda-install.sh && sh miniconda-install.sh

# Now, with conda installed (you might need to reload your terminal), install
# MEEP and some other libraries
conda create -n pmeep -c conda-forge pymeep=*=mpi_mpich_* joblib pandas matplotlib h5py

# Optional: You can also install the single-core variant using the following command
conda create -n meep -c conda-forge pymeep joblib pandas matplotlib h5py
```

### Installing PlasmonicMEEP

As a second step, `cd` to the package directory and install the package using pip. This is somewhat inconsistent, I'm working on a fix. This installs all the entrypoints to your current conda environment, so be sure to have the correct environment activated.

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, you should find three executables, namely:

- `plas-meep`, which does the FDTD calculations,
- `plas-field`, which fourier transforms the time series data and calculates field enhancements,
- `plas-vis`, that visualises the calculated enhancements as a spectrum and as a map.

## Example usage

```bash
# perform step 1, parallel run on 2 processors. The default geometry are two spherical
# gold nanoparticles with a radius of 50 nm and a spacing of 5 nm. The '-r 200' part
# gives the resolution of the computational box in px / Âµm. The -x and -y flags govern the
# size of the computational box. The '-o' parameter specifies an output directory.
mpirun -np 2 plas-meep -r 200 -x 1 -y 1 -o data/

# Calculate the FFT and the field enhancements in batches from the data calculated
# in the first step. The '-f' and '-w' flags are not required any more.
plas-field -s 100 ./data/plas-meep-norm.h5 ./data/plas-meep-ref.h5 ./data/freqs.h5

# Visualize the calculated field enhancement arrays. This will produce a spectrum
# window first and, after closing it, show the field enhancement maps.
plas-vis -k 50 ./data/freqs.h5
```

## Usage on the compute cluster ARA (FSU Jena)

### Installation

To make this program easy to use on ARA, I provide a conda environment. To use it, copy (or soft-link) the `.condarc` (conda configuration) [file](./.condarc) to your home directory by running the following command. **Be careful:** If you have a `.condarc` already, it will be overwritten.

```bash
cp .condarc ~/.condarc
```

Now, load the proper Python module, activate the conda environment and you should be
ready to calculate away.

```bash
# This is optional, but good practice, especially when you have some other conda
# instance running.
module purge

# Now you load the Python 3.8 installation. It automatically comes with conda.
module load tools/python/3.8

# If it's the first time you use conda on ARA, you should initialise conda like so:
conda init bash

# Now activate the conda environment that gives you MEEP.
# It comes with MPI for parallel usage.
conda activate pmeep
```

Now, you're able to rock away. To test that you actually have the correct python and MEEP
installed, you can run the following:

```bash
$ which python3
/beegfs/lu27wil/apps/conda-envs/pmeep/bin/python3

$ python3 -c "import meep; print(meep.__version__)"
Using MPI version 3.1, 1 processes
1.16.1
```

### Running jobs on the cluster

**WARNING: Never ever run jobs on the front nodes! Always use output directories on the parallel file system (`/beegfs/$USER/...`)!**

With that out of the way, in the root directory of the repository, you find two files [`pmeep_submit.sh`](./pmeep_submit.sh) and [`pfield_submit.sh`](./pfield_submit.sh). Those files are to be used with the SLURM queuing system.

**TODO**
